## About this Webpage

    Now Spinning is a webpage designed to bring you the newest music releases, showcasing the artist name and song title along with their album artwork, plus a link to check out even more hits. We also have a little theme music going in the background while you pruse the current hits. It is played using YouTube where you can click the video and be taken directly to YouTube to watch official music videos if you wish. YouTube has a copyright on their official music videos so we were unable to add them to our web application.
